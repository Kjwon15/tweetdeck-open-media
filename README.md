# Tweetdeck open media

Tweetdeck has many keyboard shortcuts (eg. hjkl). But it does not have shortcut for media preview.
So I made it for convenience.


## Usage

Just press "o" to preview images in selected tweet.

<kbd>y</kbd> to Copy current tweet's permalink or opened image's URL.


## Install

Click [here][userscript] to install on Greasemonkey ans their family.
